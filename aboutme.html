    <!-- create a menu using unordered list. inside it we have list and these will be the links inside the menu-. 
		at first had buller points and line undr it. so to change this style ur ul in .css 
		
		to create help create a box around the list use the nav container and place the ul inside the nav tags. We use the 
		nav tags for a menu cuz the browser actually identitfies this section as a menu so its a good idea not to use a pair 
		of div tags which is what i was thinking to create a section. cuz the div tag doesnt really identify what were 
		inserting inside of it. Helps the browser see what inside ur code

            I recently completed a opportunity as a Software Engineer and
            Project Manager. In that, I helped revamp the companyâ€™s systems to
            include elegant efficient systems and interfaces. I managed a
            California State funded project that produced $1,190,000 and
            expanded our customer profile by ten percent.
            <br /><br />
            Before that I worked as a Front End Developer as an Intern, and was
            instrumental in the enhancement of our website. I showcased numerous
            functionality which helped refine our website. I also produced a
            step by step user interactive website tour that guided users through
            the features of our website.
