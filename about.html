    <!-- create a menu using unordered list. inside it we have list and these will be the links inside the menu-. 
		at first had buller points and line undr it. so to change this style ur ul in .css 
		
		to create help create a box around the list use the nav container and place the ul inside the nav tags. We use the 
		nav tags for a menu cuz the browser actually identitfies this section as a menu so its a good idea not to use a pair 
		of div tags which is what i was thinking to create a section. cuz the div tag doesnt really identify what were 
		inserting inside of it. Helps the browser see what inside ur code
