    <!-- create a menu using unordered list. inside it we have list and these will be the links inside the menu-. 
    at first had buller points and line undr it. so to change this style ur ul in .css 
		
    to create help create a box around the list use the nav container and place the ul inside the nav tags. We use the 
    nav tags for a menu cuz the browser actually identitfies this section as a menu so its a good idea not to use a pair 
    of div tags which is what i was thinking to create a section. cuz the div tag doesnt really identify what were 
    inserting inside of it. Helps the browser see what inside ur code

      <p>Internship Work</p>
      <p>
        Overview: At my internship at Century Business Solutions I applied so
        much of the conceptual knowledge I learned through school and
        independent work. It was a great first oppurtunity for me to showcase
        the quality work I am capable of.

        Responsibilities
        <li>
          I particpated and contributed in all meetings in each phase of the>
          Software Development Lifecycle. We would have meetings for each of the
          SDLC phases so requirments gathering meetings, planning meetings,
          development meetings, testing meetings, and all the way through till
          deployment meetings.
        </li>
        <li>
          As a Front End Developer Intern, I was constantly in contact with our
          UX/UI designers and other team members so I could get a strong
          understanding of what needed to be developed. Once I developed code
          for the wireframes I was presented I would go to our team members for
          feedback. Once the UX/UI designers signed off I would ask my
          supervisor how thing looked. Any time feedback was given for
          improvement I would go to the code and adjust whatever needed to be
          adjusted. Once the website resembled the wireframes exactly or very
          closely we would pass it onto QA for testing.
        </li>
        <li>
          I also customized invoices for Century Buisness Solutions merchants.
          We had a default template that would be sent out from our merchants to
          their cusotomers when a purchase was made. However we allowed our
          merchants to customize these templates however they wanted. I was
          designated with the task of customizing these invoices to the
          satisfaction of our merchants.
        </li>
      </p>

      <p>Work Assignments and Projects
      I was given a challenge to design the company website. I was to replicate the design pretty much pixel perfect to what was expected and I was able to do that
